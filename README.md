Algorithm:

Study AI models capable of video generation from text prompts.

Identify tool capabilities and limitations.

Begin with basic prompts to generate simple videos.

Refine prompts with more details.

Add motion, timing, and camera movement.

Test different video styles.

Iterate by modifying prompts.

Save and compare outputs for evaluation.

Procedure:

Sample Prompts for Each Stage of Video Generation

Below are practical example prompts demonstrating different prompting techniques used during the experiment.

1. Simple Prompts (Basic Level)

These prompts help understand the default behavior of the video model.

Example Simple Prompts
“A person walking in a park.”
“Clouds moving slowly in the sky.”
“A dog running across a field.”
“Waves hitting the shore.”
2. Detailed Prompts (Descriptive Level)

Details include colors, lighting, atmosphere, objects, and environment.

Example Detailed Prompts
“A person in a red jacket walking on a sunny park path with birds flying overhead.”
“A rainy street with reflections on the ground and people holding umbrellas.”
“Close-up raindrops sliding over green leaves in soft morning light.”
“A mountain landscape with deep orange sunset and snow-covered peaks.”
3. Motion & Camera Prompts (Intermediate Level)

Focus on movement, transitions, and camera operations.

Example Motion Prompts
“A time-lapse of the sun setting over the ocean with waves speeding up.”
“Drone footage flying above snowy mountains, camera moving forward.”
“A slow-motion shot of a basketball bouncing on a court.”
“Camera zooming out from a forest to reveal a wide landscape.”
4. Style-Based Prompts (Advanced Level)

Specify artistic, cinematic, or animated styles.

Example Style Prompts
“A futuristic animated city with neon lights and flying cars.”
“A cinematic clip of a lion walking in the desert with dramatic lighting.”
“A watercolor-style animation of a river flowing through a forest.”
“A clay-animation style clip of a character climbing a mountain.”
5. Refined & Complex Prompts (Expert Level)

Combine detail, motion, timing, and style.

Example Complex Prompts
“A cinematic chase scene at night with a car speeding through neon-lit streets, camera following from behind, reflections visible on wet asphalt.”
“A time-lapse of a city skyline transitioning from day to night, with lights turning on gradually and clouds moving quickly.”
“A drone shot rising above a waterfall, transitioning smoothly to a wide landscape of green mountains under golden sunset light.”
“A 3D animated robot walking through a futuristic factory with sparks, glowing lights, and moving mechanical arms.”
Comparison Table: Prompt vs Video Output

Below is a structured comparison table showing how different prompt types affect the video result.

Table 1: Effect of Prompt Complexity on Video Quality
Prompt Type	Example Prompt	Video Output Characteristics	Quality Rating
Simple Prompt	“A person walking in a park.”	Basic motion, generic park background, limited detail.	★★☆☆☆
Detailed Prompt	“A person in a red jacket walking on a sunny park path with birds flying overhead.”	More accurate visuals, colors, and environmental elements; better realism.	★★★☆☆
Motion Prompt	“Camera slowly zooming out from a beach during sunset.”	Smooth camera movement, enhanced cinematic effect.	★★★★☆
Style Prompt	“An animated futuristic city with neon lights.”	Strong stylization, consistent theme, visually unique.	★★★★☆
Complex Prompt	“A cinematic car chase in a neon-lit city with reflections on wet streets.”	High-quality motion, detailed scene, improved lighting, transitions, and realism.	★★★★★
Table 2: Effect of Style Prompts on Output
Style Type	Example Prompt	Result
Realistic	“A real-life video of waves hitting rocks at the beach.”	Natural lighting, smooth motion, high realism.
Animated	“A cartoon-style ocean with stylized waves moving rhythmically.”	Exaggerated geometry, smoother motion, simplified textures.
Cinematic	“A cinematic shot of a forest with sunlight piercing through trees.”	Dramatic lighting, color grading, slow camera movements.
Artistic	“A watercolor animation of clouds drifting across the sky.”	Soft edges, pastel colors, fluid transitions.
Result:

The prompting techniques for AI video generation were successfully studied and applied.
Different prompt styles demonstrated clear variations in video output quality, motion smoothness, realism, and artistic style.
The experiment confirms that well-crafted, detailed, and structured prompts produce significantly better video results.
