Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

Date : 25.11.25
Reg. No: 212223020011



Aim:
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.

Procedure:
Analyze the Given Image: ○ Examine the image carefully, noting key elements such as: ■ Objects/Subjects (e.g., people, animals, objects) ■ Colors (e.g., dominant hues, contrasts) ■ Textures (e.g., smooth, rough, glossy) ■ Lighting (e.g., bright, dim, shadows) ■ Background (e.g., outdoor, indoor, simple, detailed) ■ Composition (e.g., focal points, perspective) ■ Style (e.g., realistic, artistic, cartoonish)
Create the Basic Prompt: ○ Write an initial, simple description of the image. For example, if the image shows a landscape, the prompt could be "A serene landscape with mountains and a river."
Refine the Prompt with More Detail: ○ Add specific details such as colors, mood, and time of day. For example: "A serene landscape during sunset with purple mountains, a calm river reflecting the colors of the sky, and a few trees along the shore."
Identify Style and Artistic Influences: ○ If the image has a particular style (e.g., impressionist painting, realistic photography, minimalistic), include that in the prompt. For example: "A serene landscape in the style of a watercolor painting with soft, blended colors."
Adjust and Fine-tune: ○ Refine the prompt further by adding specific instructions about elements like textures, weather conditions, or any other distinctive features in the image. For example: "A serene landscape during sunset with purple mountains, a calm river reflecting the colors of the sky, a few trees along the shore, and soft, pastel tones in the clouds."
Generate the Image: ○ Use the crafted prompt to generate the image in a text-to-image model (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney).
Compare the Generated Image with the Original: ○ Assess how closely the generated image matches the original in terms of colors, composition, subject, and style. Note the differences and refine the prompt if necessary.
Tools/LLMs for Image Generation:
● DALL·E (by OpenAI): A text-to-image generation tool capable of creating detailed images from textual prompts. ○ Website: DALL·E ● Stable Diffusion: An open-source model for generating images from text prompts, known for its flexibility and customizable outputs. ○ Website: Stable Diffusion ● MidJourney: A popular AI tool for generating visually striking and creative images based on text descriptions. ○ Website: MidJourney

COMPARISON & CONCLUSION

The birds’ details were accurately reproduced, and the refined version improved color vibrancy and clarity.

The unicorn portrait was nearly identical to the original, with enhanced pastel colors and smooth watercolor-style textures.

The experiment demonstrated how refined prompts help create more accurate and artistic reproductions of reference images.

Iterative prompt adjustments improve realism, artistic style, and visual quality in AI-generated images.
